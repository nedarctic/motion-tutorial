        Every year, over two million animals — mostly wildebeest, but also zebra and gazelle — embark on a 1,800-mile circular journey across Tanzania and Kenya. It is raw, chaotic, breathtaking, and utterly humbling.
      </p>
      <p class="text-[#DCCAB2]/80 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        This is the Great Migration — the largest overland migration on the planet, and without question one of the last true wilderness spectacles left on Earth.
